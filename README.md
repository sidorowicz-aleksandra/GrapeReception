# GrapeReception
Repository contains all needed materials to run algorithm for a grape reception scheduling. Detailed description of the algoithm can be found in [this](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00469) paper.

## Getting Started
All the scripts are written in R programming launguage. 

### Prerequisites
- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)

### Running the tests
In order to run the algorithm, download this repository and run the whole script 
[run_model_opti.R](https://github.com/sidorowicz-aleksandra/GrapeReception/blob/master/run_model_opti.R). All input files for test run are stored in [data](https://github.com/sidorowicz-aleksandra/GrapeReception/tree/master/data/Poisson) folder.

The output will be printed in the console and also written in the Results_10_R_R_.xlsx file.
